        <h1>Current Events in Software Development: The Good and the Bad</h1>
        <h3>BESP</h3>
        <p>
            In this group project, we researched two recent news articles related to software development. One article showed a positive event: AI tools improving web accessibility for people with disabilities. The second article was negative: a major data breach at a tech company that exposed millions of users’ information. We summarized both articles and created an infographic with clear visuals and key facts. The goal was to understand how real-world news affects our field and what we can learn from it as future professionals.
