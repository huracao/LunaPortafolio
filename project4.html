            For this project, we had to design a website for a music festival called Next Wave Fest. The goal was to create a visually appealing and informative site that would attract young music lovers and showcase emerging artists. We used HTML and CSS to build the structure and style of the site. The webpage included sections for the festival introduction, lineup of artists, ticket information, and location details. We focused on making the design vibrant and modern to match the festival's energy. It was a good challenge to organize the content using flexbox and grid. Additionally, we used media queries to ensure the site was responsive on mobile devices. We also added a navigation menu to make it easy for visitors to explore different sections.

            <p><strong>3. Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, I improved my ability to use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes and learned how to create a more visually appealing design with CSS animations.</p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>4. How could you improve this project if given more time or resources?</strong></p>
            <p>If I had more time, I would add more interactive elements like hover effects and smooth transitions to make the website more engaging and professional looking.</p>
