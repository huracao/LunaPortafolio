        <h3>Manipulation and Programming</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, we are going to create a "Choose Your Adventure" game. The game will be made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will design the story so players can make decisions that affect the outcome. The game's progress will be saved using LocalStorage. Each part of the story will be stored in a file called data.js, and we'll use JSON format to organize it. The game will start with a main page where users can choose to start or continue their game. For the visual part, we will use CSS to make sure the interface is easy to use and looks good. We will also create a basic database design in case we want to expand the game later. At the end of the project, we'll present it to the teacher, showing how it works and explaining the code behind it. Finally, we'll upload everything to GitHub and make sure it's well organized.

        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>1. What difficulties or obstacles did you experience while working on this project?</strong></p>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges was deciding how to create a good storyline for the game. I also struggled with making sure the JavaScript worked smoothly, especially with LocalStorage.</p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>2. What skills did you apply during this project?</strong></p>
            <p>I used my skills in coding, especially HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also used creative writing skills to develop the story and decision-making paths for the game.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>3. Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, I improved my JavaScript skills, especially when it came to handling dynamic content and saving the player's progress. I also learned how to structure a story in a way that allows for multiple outcomes based on player choices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>4. How could you improve this project if given more time or resources?</strong></p>
            <p>With more time, I would add more complex storylines and more choices, so the game feels even more interactive. I'd also improve the design to make the game look more professional and maybe add sound effects for a better experience.</p>
