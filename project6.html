        <h1>CRUD Web App in PHP</h1>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed a PHP web application to manage project records in a PostgreSQL database. First, I created a table named 'proyectos' with fields for ID, name, description, start date, end date, and status. Then, I set up the main files: 'index.php' to display the project list, 'crear.php' to add new projects, 'editar.php' to update project details, and 'eliminar.php'
             to delete records. I implemented SQL queries for each CRUD operation, ensuring data integrity and error handling. Additionally, I added a status dropdown with options like "Planned," "In Progress," and "Completed" to keep project statuses organized. Finally, I tested each feature to confirm the correct functioning of the app, focusing on data updates and record deletion.

        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>1. What difficulties or obstacles did you experience while working on this project?</strong></p>
            <p>Setting up the PostgreSQL connection and ensuring all CRUD operations worked correctly was challenging, especially handling errors during the editing and deleting processes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>2. What skills did you apply during this project?</strong></p>
            <p>I applied my knowledge of PHP to handle form data, SQL to manage the database, and basic HTML/CSS to structure and style the interface.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>3. Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, I improved my ability to work with PostgreSQL and learned how to implement dropdown menus in PHP using the 'select' element.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>4. How could you improve this project if given more time or resources?</strong></p>
            <p>I would add input validation to prevent SQL injection and implement a search function to filter projects based on their status or date range.</p>
