        <h1>BD Hacking</h1>
        <h3>Manipulation</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, I acted as an ethical hacker to restore and secure a company's database after a cyberattack. First, I ran a SQL file to rebuild the database structure. Then, I added the missing email column in the employees table and reinserted lost employee records.
            I identified employees with salaries outside the standard range and corrected altered names, like "XXXXX XXXXX," restoring it to the original name. I also removed a fake user named "Usuario Falso."
            Next, I generated reports showing employees assigned to projects and projects with the most staff. Lastly, I updated developer salaries that had been reduced and restored the start dates of two key projects.

            <p><strong>1. What difficulties or obstacles did you experience while working on this project?</strong></p>
            <p>I found it tricky to locate the altered data and correct it accurately, especially when dealing with missing records and identifying fake users.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>2. What skills did you apply during this project?</strong></p>
            <p>I applied SQL commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to manage data, and used JOIN to connect tables and extract specific information.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>3. Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, I got better at using GROUP BY to generate reports and identifying data inconsistencies quickly.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>4. How could you improve this project if given more time or resources?</strong></p>
            <p>With more time, I would create a backup system to prevent data loss and add more detailed reports for better data analysis.</p>
