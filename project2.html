        <h1>Farewell to my Specialty: A Poetical Compilation!</h1>
        <h3>BESP</h3>
        <p>
            We wrote a poem about our time in the specialty from 10th to 12th grade. We included our experiences, lessons, and important moments. We used simple poetic devices like metaphors and similes to make the poem more interesting. Then, we decorated the poster with a lot of drawings. It was a chance to remember how much we have grown and learned. We also used technical vocabulary related to our specialty to include in the poem. We felt proud to share our work with the teacher. This project helped us reflect on our time in the specialty.
